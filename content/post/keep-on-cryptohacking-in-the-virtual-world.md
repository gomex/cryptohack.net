We're pleased to announce that we're locking in a regular monthly timeslot for our virtual hack nights. We're going to be cryptohacking on the last Wednesday night of each month. __The first one will be on Wednesday 27th April, starting at [7:30pm Melbourne/Sydney time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Cryptohack+Virtual+Hack+Night&iso=20160427T1930&p1=152).__

Hopefully you've seen our virtual hack nights [some time](announcing-10th-feb-virtual-hack-night.html) [in the last few months](announcing-2nd-march-virtual-hack-night.html). We've invited Cryptohackers, and folks who are new to our community to come together in the same virtual place and get stuff done. It is a format we've been experimenting with, so we can include as many Cryptohackers as possible to share skills and knowledge, and contribute to open source projects like [Pixelated](https://pixelated-project.org).

This time will be a little different. With these new regular events, we want to create more of a virtual co-working space, where people can work on whatever privacy stuff they're interested in right now, and share ideas.

It might be Pixelated, it might be writing a blog post, or it might be preparing a talk. Whatever you're working on, mark the dates in your calendar and come and work on it with us. Other Cryptohackers might even be able to help you out!

If you are keen to contribute to the privacy movement, but don't have something to work on right now, here are some ideas that you could join us to work on:

* Pixelated ([here are some issues you can work on!](https://github.com/pixelated/pixelated-user-agent/labels/Volunteer%20task))
* Translate Pixelated video captions (talk to Pam if you're keen)
* Write a blog post. We'll post it on cryptohack.net, and/or send it out to our networks. (Talk to Pam, Cam, Robin or Andrew). Here are some ideas:
    * Password managers comparison
    * N things you can do to improve your privacy online
    * Privacy bodge of the week (summaries of recent privacy-related news)
* Bring your own privacy project, and tell us all about it.
* Chat about privacy issues in the news (talk to everybody!)
